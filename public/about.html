<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After graduating in the field of Mining Engineering, I worked as a Mining Engineer for four years. 
  Following this period, I transitioned to a role as a Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor, where I worked for five years. 
  Due to my growing interest in the software sector, I decided to shift my career to this field and attended 
  a bootcamp program that provided comprehensive training in Java. Additionally, during this bootcamp, 
  I received training in Selenium, Cucumber, JUnit, TestNG, API, Appium, SDLC, STLC, JDBC, Selenium Grid, Jira, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
</p>

<p>I participated in a year-long project as a QA Tester, where I gained valuable experience in backend, frontend, and manual testing. 
   After the project, I learned Cypress and JavaScript to further enhance my skills and meet industry demands. 
   As a Tester, I aim to build upon the knowledge and experience I have gained and contribute effectively to the software testing processes.
